I am a 4th year undergraduate student at Washington University in St. Louis, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. My interests are in Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, and information theory.

In this blog, I'll be posting on topics such as, but not limited to:

- Bayesian deep learning
- Bayesian optimization
- Gaussian Processes
- Information Theory
- Machine Learning
- Bayesian inference
- Monte Carlo methods
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
- Variational Inference
- Generative Models
- Unsupervised/Semi-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning
- Measure Theory in Probability
- Leetcode Questions and Answers
